            "color": "<SECTION_COLOR>",
            "icon": {
              "family": "<SECTION_ICON_FAMILY>",
              "icon": "<SECTION_ICON_NAME>"
            },
            "videos": {
              "en": [<SECTION_YOUTUBE_IDS_VIDEOS>]
            },
            "articles": {
              "en": [<SECTION_ARTICLES>]
              },
            "publish": true/false
          },
          "<SECTION_KEY_02>": { ... }
        }

    ```

1. Fill metadata general project configuration
    ```javascript
        {
          "meta": {
            "title": "<WEBPAGE_NAME>",
            "email": "<PUBLIC_EMAIL_WEBPAGE>",
            "tlf": "<PUBLIC_TLF_WEBPAGE>",
            "background": "<FILE_NAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE>"
          },
          ...
        }

    ```

    - *title:* Here you put the web page main title will appear in the main head display
    - *background:* Here you put the file name that will be displayed as a home page background. This file has to stay:  ./content/background/<"<FILE_NAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE>

1. Edit sections configuration

    ```javascript
                {
                  ...
                  "<SECTION_KEY_01>": {
                    "name": "<SECTION_NAME>",
                    "color": "<SECTION_COLOR>",
                    "icon": {
                      "family": "<SECTION_ICON_FAMILY>",
                      "icon": "<SECTION_ICON_NAME>"
                    },
                    "videos": {
                      "en": [<SECTION_YOUTUBE_IDS_VIDEOS>]
                    },
                    "articles": {
                      "en": [<SECTION_ARTICLES>]
                      },
                    "publish": true/false
                  },
                  "<SECTION_KEY_02>": { ... }
                }

    ```

    - *<SECTION_KEY_X>:* Here you put this section key name. This name will be the key that refer to this section and it has to check with the folder name that will contain the images of the section gallery here: ./content/<SECTION_KEY_X>/images/.
    - *name:* Here you put this section name. This name will appear in each button that link to this section.
    - *color:* Color in the section styles
    - *icon:* Select an icon from [react-icons](https://gorangajic.github.io/react-icons/fa.html), select a family and a icon from there.
    - *videos:* Array of strings equal to youtube ID videos
    - *articles.en:* Array of strings that are the articles yout want to publish in your site
    - *publish:* This has to be set as true or false value. True publish the section whereas false hide it.


## Step 4: Image files

Create a folder for each section of your gallery inside ./content/<SECTION_KEY_X>/images/. Make sure the name of the folder <SECTION_KEY_X> is the same as the key you put in the Json. Inside this folder you have to copy all the images files.
