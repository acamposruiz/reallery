            },
            "articles": {

              },
            "publish": true/false
          },
          "<SECTION_KEY_02>": { ... }
        }

    ```

1. Fill metadata general project configuration
    ```javascript
        {
          "meta": {
            "title": "<WEBPAGE_NAME>",
            "email": "<PUBLIC_EMAIL_WEBPAGE>",
            "tlf": "<PUBLIC_TLF_WEBPAGE>",
            "background": "<FILE_NAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE>"
          },
          ...
        }

    ```

    - *title:* Here you put the web page main title will appear in the main head display
    - *background:* Here you put the file name that will be displayed as a home page background. This file has to stay:  ./content/background/<"<FILE_NAME_BACKGROUND_IMAGE>

    ```javascript
                {
                  ...
                  "<SECTION_KEY_01>": {
                    "name": "<SECTION_NAME>",
                    "color": "<SECTION_COLOR>",
                    "icon": {
                      "family": "<SECTION_ICON_FAMILY>",
                      "icon": "<SECTION_ICON_NAME>"
                    },
                    "videos": {
                      "en": [<SECTION_YOUTUBE_IDS_VIDEOS>]
                    },
                    "articles": {
                      "en": [<SECTION_ARTICLES>]
                      },
                    "publish": true/false
                  },
                  "<SECTION_KEY_02>": { ... }
                }

    ```
